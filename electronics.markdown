![12V part schematic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/2014-06/power.png)

The robot is powered from 3 cell LiPo battery and it uses a BEC module
to power the 5V branch.

The switch in the schematic is a big red emergency switch that cuts off power to
the motors (this should stop the robot imediately because of the high transmission
ratio).
The voltage behind the e-switch is usesd as an input to the control computer.
