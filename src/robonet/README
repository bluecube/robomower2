This directory contains an implementation of a communication protocol based on
(and probably mostly compatible with) 9 bit version of Martin Locker's RoboNet protocol:
http://wiki.robotika.cz/dispatch.fcgi/KomunikacniProtokol

The protocol is works in half-duplex mode, with master initiating all communication.
As a difference from the original protocol, each physical device has 16 addresses
(the lower 4 bits of address determine physical device, upper 4 bits have application
specific meaning). There are also 16 broadcast addresses instead of only one.

The C code in this directory is designed for ATMega8 running at 8 MHz.
It is interrupt based and uses AVR's multiprocessor mode to minimize the CPU load.
All of the interface functions are non-blocking and have as much error detection
as possible. A major weakness of this implementation is a lack of double buffering,
so it is possible to loose a message (but still detect this), if two messages are
sent to this device in a quick succession. This library, has to be compiled with
preprocessor definitions specifying the device address, baud rate and TX/RX selection pin
and some other stuff (F_CPU, ROBONET_OWN_ADDRESS, ROBONET_DIRECTION_PORT,
ROBONET_DIRECTION_BIT and BAUD).

The Python code is an implementation of a master for this protocol, using an ugly
hack to work around posix serial port not allowing 9 bit communication.
