problems with drive-board-v1:
    - Connectors are too close to each other, cannot connect programming
      cable and data cable at the same time.
    - Missing power connection in programming cable
    - Maybe use better connector for data cable?
    - Maybe use only solder pads for programming and use rs485 bootloader?
    - Sensor power should be enabled by software
