Stuff remaining to do, roughly in order.

- Raspbery PI
- Localization
- [Measure error model of odometry + calibration]({{ site.baseurl }}/movement-model.html) ?????
- GPS
- More sensors (compass!)
- Advanced GPS
- [Path planning]({{ site.baseurl }}/path-planning.html) - needs review
- Make a smarter version of the current [12V electronics]({{ site.baseurl }}/electronics.html) ?????
- Replace Raspi by Q1900DC-ITX? Antennas will be a problem. ?????

## Finished

- [Finalize driving (HW only)]({{ site.baseurl }}/motor-control.html#drive-board)
- Manual mode driving (SW)
- Rebuild the burned out drive board
- [12V electronics]({{ site.baseurl }}/electronics.html)
- [Path following]({{ site.baseurl }}/path-following.html)
- GUI proxy (networked gui using some RPC library) -- will need some more work later, though
